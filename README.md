An unified place to store and share all the style, code, process guidelines for frontend contributors.

## Frontend Guidelines

These represent a set of best practices for all UI developers. It was created so the UI code is more consistent, easier to maintain, read and test.

This will not be an in-depth set of dos and don'ts examples because the majority of the UI projects differ in framweworks and  style.

But for example because TypeScript is a subset of JavaScript it is worth taking into account applicable JavaScript guidelines to ensure good code is maintained in Typescript as well as projects with React or Vue where Typscript or Javascript may be used.

Below is a list of things that all Frontend developers should know and try to adhere too.
